# Cookie Clicker Bot
A bot I made as a learning exercise that automates the browser game [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/).

It makes use of my [`selenium_tools`](https://github.com/HMellor/selenium-tools) package as well as `asyncio`.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HMellor/cookie-clicker-bot
cd cookie-clicker-bot
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Download the uBlock Origin extension to the [extensions](extensions) folder.

## Usage
```python
python bot.py
```
